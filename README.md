# Low-Level-Image-Processing
This code is developed as one of the assignments for the course "Image Processing and Computer Vision".

The code is written in MATLAB. The project_report.pdf contains description of each subproblem, implementation details and screenshots of the results.

# To Run the code
1. Load the test images given in the "Test Images", in the working directory.
2. Run histogram_equalisation.m for histogram equalisation.
3. Check the various comparisions performed using our own function and inbuilt function.
4. Run log_mapping.m for log mapping.
5. Check the comaprisin before and after log transformation.
6. Run rotating_image.m for image rotation.
7. Provide the desired angle, when prompted.
8. Prefix - ve in the input for clock wise rotation.
9. Check the two comparisions performed using our own function and inbuilt function.
10. Run gaussian_average_filter.m for gaussian average filter.
11. Select the type of noise, you desire to add.
12. in case of salt and pepper  noise, provide the desired noise density and in case of gaussian noise, provide the variance value.
13. check the comparision between original,noisy and smoothen image.
14. Run median_filtering.m for median filtering.
15. in case of salt and pepper  noise, provide the desired noise density and in case of gaussian noise, provide the variance value.
16. check the comparision between original,noisy and filtered image.
17. You may need to edit the variable input_image in all the subproblems to make the program work for your image.
